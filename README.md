# Testing JS Frameworks
This is a personal approach to check the performance of the most popular javascript frameworks in the market nowadays. So you are able to check in your own, and by the device of your election, the amount of time each framework takes to finish the same operation. The operation developed here is just move divs around. The quatity of divs grows along the time.

You can select how many items you want the framework to move, then you get the time this particular framework need to accomplish the task and you can compare the result of differents frameworks in the same device.
