# Testing JS Frameworks
This is a personal approach to check the performance of the most popular javascript frameworks nowadays in the market. So you are able to check it on your own. You can do so with the device of your election. So you can take note of the time each framework takes to finish the same operation. The task accomplished by each app in every framework is just move divs around. The quantity of divs grows along the time as the app is running.

You can select how many items you want the framework to move, then you get the time this particular framework needs to accomplish the task. You can compare the time each framework takes to accomplish the same task.
